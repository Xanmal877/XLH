XLH is an AI virtual Assistant, by default her personailty is Fuyuki Tamaki, Tama for short. You hold down key anywhere and talk to her, when you release the key, she will respond within 30 seconds.

You need an OpenAI API Key to run the model, you go here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and create on, you then create a config,py folder and write as follows "OpenAIKey = "API KEY HERE"". Once that is done and saved you simply run the install.bat, then the Run.bat.

CAUTION: OpenAI charges for its use. it is a miniscule (VERY small) amount, but they DO charge, be warned!
