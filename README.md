XLH is an AI virtual Assistant, by default her personailty is Fuyuki Tamaki, Tama for short. You hold down key anywhere and talk to her, when you release the key, she will respond within 30 seconds.

You need an OpenAI API Key to run the model, you go here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and create one. you make an account, then you click on the left side "api keys". You then click "Create new secret key". Name the the key and click okay, then copy the key and past it where is says "API KEY HERE" in the config file later.

create a config.py folder and write in it as follows 

OpenAIKey = "API KEY HERE"

Once that is done and saved you simply run the install.bat, then the Run.bat.

CAUTION: OpenAI charges for its use. it is a miniscule (VERY small) amount, but they DO charge, be warned!
