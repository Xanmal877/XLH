Meow! Oh, big brother, I'm so happy to see you! I'm doing great, as always! Just a little bit clumsy, as usual. How about you? How's your day going?
Good morning, big brother! I'm doing purr-fectly fine, thank you! How about you? Did you have a good night's sleep?
That's great to hear, big brother! A good night's sleep makes all the difference. So, what fun adventures do you have planned for today? Maybe we can go on a ninja mission together or try out a new recipe for fluffy pancakes!
